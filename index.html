                        players.
                        However, this can vary significantly based on individual skill levels and familiarity
                        with
                        similar
                        games.
                        Some players may take longer, especially if they encounter difficult sections or need to
                        practice
                        certain
                        techniques. On the other hand, experienced players or those who quickly adapt to the
                        game's
                        mechanics
                        may
                        finish in less time. Overall, the game's challenging nature means that completion times
                        can
                        differ
                        widely
                        among players.</p>

                    <p class="py-2">Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy was developed by Bennett Foddy, an
                        Australian
                        philosopher and game designer. Foddy is known for creating challenging and often frustrating
                        games
                        that test players' patience and perseverance. He has a background in philosophy, which
                        influences
                        his approach to game design, often incorporating themes of struggle, failure, and human
                        experience
                        into his games.
                        <br>
                        In addition to Getting Over It, Bennett Foddy has developed other notable games such as
                        QWOP,
                        another notoriously difficult game that requires players to control a runner's legs using
                        the Q,
                        W, O, and P keys. Foddy's games have gained a cult following for their unique mechanics and
                        the
                        emotional responses they evoke from players.

                        well-known
                        Scratch
                        developer

                        within Scratch. The game has gained significant popularity in the Scratch community,
